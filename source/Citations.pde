A LOT of the code and resources are my own, but not all of it.

All of the toxic libs physics is based off the work of Dan Shiffman. Because his code isn't directly
used anywhere, I just included the link at the top of the project

The music in this project is from chillhop.com, a service for creators by creators that allows lofi 
music to be shared and used in content. Each creator is cited more carefully when their music is
declared.

The images in this project is from the flickr creative commons. Again, each image is cited more
