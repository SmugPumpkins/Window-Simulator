I would definitely say I am much happier with how this project turned out than project 3. I think
it really helped that all the things I wanted to do weren't to hard to figure out. And the one part
that I did struggle with (making multiple arrays and for loops for a plant) I was able to just
brute force my way through (which wasn't ideal, but I got the end product I wanted). Through this
project I wanted to comment on isolation. Many times throught this pandemic, I've looked out my
window and wanted to be somewhere else. The window I have created here I would say is even more
isolating than the window in my kitchen. The plants don't grow, the light is all digital, the
images are just that, the fog on the windows is just a white rectangle, and the "helpful Nathan" is
just a series of pictures and audio files. I think many over the course of the past few months 
have turned to technology as an escape instead of elsewhere. Technology is just so easy. Why go
experience nature when you can look through a fake window on your laptop? And it's a mindset
that's taken a toll. If anything, I think working on this project taught me to just go outside. 
And while I hope other's first interactions with it they find it interesting, ultimately I hope
it leaves them longing for the real thing enough to get up and go for a walk.
